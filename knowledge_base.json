As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the air. Short-wavelength light, such as blue light, is scattered more because it travels in smaller waves. This scattered blue light is what we typically see when looking at the sky. During sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange due to a different type of scattering called scattering by molecules and dust particles, which is more effective at scattering longer wavelengths of light.\n\n","query":"why is the sky blue","timestamp":1744758162600},{"response":"AI Response:\n The capital of Algeria is Algiers.
