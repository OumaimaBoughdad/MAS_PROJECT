It has applications in many fields of social science, and is used extensively in economics, logic, systems science and computer science. Initially, game theory addressed two-person zero-sum games, in which a participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by the losses and gains of the other participant. In the 1950s, it was extended to the study of non zero-sum games, and was eventually applied to a wide range of behavioral relations. It is now an umbrella term for the science of rational decision making in humans, animals, and computers. Modern game theory began with the idea of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics.\n\n[OpenRouter Result]\n\n\n Game theory is a branch of mathematics and social science that studies strategic interactions among rational decision-makers. It provides a framework for analyzing situations where multiple entities, called players, make decisions and act based on their own interests, but their actions affect the payoffs or outcomes of others.\n\nGame theory is widely used in economics, political science, psychology, computer science, and many other fields. It helps to understand situations like competitive markets, political negotiations, military strategy, and even social interactions.\n\nGame theory is based on a set of assumptions, including rationality, where players make decisions to maximize their utility or benefit, and complete information, where all players know the rules, payoffs, and strategies of others. However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are often simplifications and may not always hold true.\n\nSome famous examples of game theory concepts include the Prisoner's Dilemma, Nash Equilibrium, and the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Game theory is a powerful tool for understanding complex situations and making better decisions in strategic interactions.\n\n[Wikidata Result]\n\n\ngame theory: branch of mathematics focused on strategic decision making\n\n[Langsearch Result]\n\n\n\n\u2022 Game theory - Wikipedia\n  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory\n  game theory article talk game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions .

It encompasses several key topics, including:\n\n1. **Mind-Body Problem**: The central issue in the philosophy of mind is the nature of the mind and its relationship to the physical world. This question is often framed as the mind-body problem, which asks whether the mind is identical to, emerges from, or is epiphenomenal to the brain.\n\n2. **Consciousness**: Philosophers debate the nature of consciousness, what it consists of, and what it allows us to know. Questions about consciousness include: What is it? What does it feel like? How does it arise from the brain?\n\n3. **Personality and Self**: Philosophers explore the nature of the self, personal identity, and the concept of the soul. Questions include: What makes someone the same person over time? What is the relationship between the self and the body?\n\n4. **Cognition**: Philosophers consider the nature of thought, reasoning, and belief. Questions include: How do we think? What are beliefs and how do they differ from desires?\n\n5. **Artificial Intelligence**: Philosophers discuss the nature of artificial intelligence and its implications for the mind. Questions include: Can machines think? What does it mean for a machine to be conscious?\n\n6. **Free Will**: Philosophers examine the nature of free will and determinism. Questions include: Do we have free will? If so, what does it mean, and how does it interact with causal determinism?\n\n7. **Mental Illness**: Philosophers explore the nature of mental illness and its treatment. Questions include: What is mental illness? How should we understand and respond to it?\n\nThese topics are not exhaustive, and many other issues fall under the umbrella of the philosophy of mind.\n\n[Wikidata Result]\n\n\n: No description available\n\n[Langsearch Result]\n\n\n\n\u2022 Independence Day (United States) - Wikipedia\n  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)\n  independence day ( united states ) independence day fireworks displays , such as these over the washington monument in 1986 , take place annually across the united states on july 4 th , known as i...

The resulting collection preserved hundreds of life stories from 17 U.S. states that would otherwise have been lost in din of modernity and America's eagerness to deliberately forget the blot on its recent past.

The term may encompass computer systems and programs designed to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI can be classified into two main categories: Narrow AI, which is designed to perform a specific task (e.g., voice recognition), and General AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do.
