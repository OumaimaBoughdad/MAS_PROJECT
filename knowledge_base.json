It has applications in many fields of social science, and is used extensively in economics, logic, systems science and computer science. Initially, game theory addressed two-person zero-sum games, in which a participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by the losses and gains of the other participant. In the 1950s, it was extended to the study of non zero-sum games, and was eventually applied to a wide range of behavioral relations. It is now an umbrella term for the science of rational decision making in humans, animals, and computers. Modern game theory began with the idea of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics.\n\n[OpenRouter Result]\n\n\n Game theory is a branch of mathematics and social science that studies strategic interactions among rational decision-makers. It provides a framework for analyzing situations where multiple entities, called players, make decisions and act based on their own interests, but their actions affect the payoffs or outcomes of others.\n\nGame theory is widely used in economics, political science, psychology, computer science, and many other fields. It helps to understand situations like competitive markets, political negotiations, military strategy, and even social interactions.\n\nGame theory is based on a set of assumptions, including rationality, where players make decisions to maximize their utility or benefit, and complete information, where all players know the rules, payoffs, and strategies of others. However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are often simplifications and may not always hold true.\n\nSome famous examples of game theory concepts include the Prisoner's Dilemma, Nash Equilibrium, and the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

It encompasses several key topics, including:\n\n1. **Mind-Body Problem**: The central issue in the philosophy of mind is the nature of the mind and its relationship to the physical world. This question is often framed as the mind-body problem, which asks whether the mind is identical to, emerges from, or is epiphenomenal to the brain.\n\n2. **Consciousness**: Philosophers debate the nature of consciousness, what it consists of, and what it allows us to know. Questions about consciousness include: What is it? What does it feel like? How does it arise from the brain?\n\n3. **Personality and Self**: Philosophers explore the nature of the self, personal identity, and the concept of the soul. Questions include: What makes someone the same person over time? What is the relationship between the self and the body?\n\n4. **Cognition**: Philosophers consider the nature of thought, reasoning, and belief. Questions include: How do we think? What are beliefs and how do they differ from desires?\n\n5. **Artificial Intelligence**: Philosophers discuss the nature of artificial intelligence and its implications for the mind. Questions include: Can machines think? What does it mean for a machine to be conscious?\n\n6. **Free Will**: Philosophers examine the nature of free will and determinism. Questions include: Do we have free will? If so, what does it mean, and how does it interact with causal determinism?\n\n7. **Mental Illness**: Philosophers explore the nature of mental illness and its treatment. Questions include: What is mental illness? How should we understand and respond to it?\n\nThese topics are not exhaustive, and many other issues fall under the umbrella of the philosophy of mind.\n\n[Wikidata Result]\n\n\n: No description available\n\n[Langsearch Result]\n\n\n\n\u2022 Independence Day (United States) - Wikipedia\n  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)\n  independence day ( united states ) independence day fireworks displays , such as these over the washington monument in 1986 , take place annually across the united states on july 4 th , known as i...

The term may encompass computer systems and programs designed to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI can be classified into two main categories: Narrow AI, which is designed to perform a specific task (e.g., voice recognition), and General AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do.

European Union: The European Union has been at the forefront of AI regulation. The European Commission proposed the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) in April 2021, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for AI, including high-risk AI systems. The AIA plans to ban AI systems that use sensitive personal data for certain purposes, such as real-time recognition of human faces in publicly accessible spaces for non-law enforcement purposes.\n\n2. United States: In the US, there have been several federal and state-level initiatives. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issued an Executive Order on AI (February 2023) that reaffirmed the need for federal engagement in AI, including the establishment of a national AI Research and Development strategy and a Federal AI R&D Strategic Coordinating Committee. At the state level, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which gives consumers the right to know about AI systems that collect personal data, and the right to opt-out of the sale of personal data to third parties.\n\n3. United Kingdom: The UK has also taken steps to regulate AI. The UK's Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018) includes provisions for data protection in AI systems, and the government has published a Code of Practice for the use of artificial intelligence in the UK's public sector.\n\n4. International: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been working on AI ethics and governance, and has published several reports and guidelines. The United Nations has also been active in AI regulation, with the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation (2018) and the Secretary-General's Roadmap for Digital Cooperation (2019) emphasizing the need for international cooperation on AI.\n\n5. Industry Initiatives: Several tech companies and industry groups have also proposed their own guidelines for responsible AI. For example, the Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society and the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund, founded by the Ford Foundation, Omidyar Network, and the Hewlett Foundation, are working to support the responsible development and use of AI.\n\n6. AI Auditing: There's an increasing focus on AI auditing, which involves assessing the ethical and technical aspects of AI systems. Companies like Alegion, Sage AI, and Algorithmic Justice League are providing AI auditing services to help organizations ensure their AI systems are fair, transparent, and accountable.\n\n[Langsearch Result]\n\n\n\n\u2022 The Biggest AI Policy Developments of 2023 | TIME\n  https://time.com/6513046/ai-policy-developments-2023/\n  tech artificial intelligence the 3 most important ai policy milestones of 2023 i n november 2022 , openai launched chatgpt . within five days , it had over a million users . six months later ,...

Software also includes design documents and specifications. The history of software is closely tied to the development of digital computers in the mid-20th century. Early programs were written in the machine language specific to the hardware. The introduction of high-level programming languages in 1958 allowed for more human-readable instructions, making software development easier and more portable across different computer architectures. Software in a programming language is run through a compiler or interpreter to execute on the architecture's hardware. Over time, software has become complex, owing to developments in networking, operating systems, and databases. Software can generally be categorized into two main types: 1. operating systems, which manage hardware resources and provide services for applications 2.\n\n[Together Result]\nSoftware is a set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. It is designed to perform specific tasks on a computer, such as running applications, processing data, or controlling hardware. Software can be divided into two main categories: system software, which manages the computer's hardware and provides a platform for application software, and application software, which allows users to perform specific tasks, such as word processing, browsing the internet, or playing games.

However, if you're looking for something different, Colleen Hoover has written in various genres, so I would recommend checking out her other works, such as \"November 9\" for romance, \"Verity\" for thriller, or \"Regretting You\" for women's fiction.\n\n[OpenRouter Result]\n\n\n Given Colleen Hoover's popular genre of contemporary romance with a twist, I would recommend suggesting the following books that have a similar style:\n\n1. \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\" by Taylor Jenkins Reid: This book is a captivating, entertaining, and heartbreaking tale of a reclusive Hollywood starlet who decides to share her life story with a young journalist.\n\n2. \"Me Before You\" by Jojo Moyes: A heartwarming love story about a small-town girl who becomes a caregiver for a wealthy, paralyzed man and falls in love with him, exploring themes of love, life, and disability.\n\n3. \"The Unexpected Everything\" by Morgan Matson: This book is a young adult romance about a girl who has her life plans disrupted when her father's campaign for a Senate seat derails, leading her to unexpected encounters and experiences.\n\n4. \"The Rosie Project\" by Graeme Simsion: A charming and unconventional tale of a socially awkward but brilliant academic who devises a scientifically based survey to find the perfect woman, only to have his life upended by a woman who doesn't fit his criteria.\n\n5. \"One Day in December\" by Lucinda Riley: A heartwarming and romantic novel about a woman who glimpses a man on the street one day, and spends her life wondering what could have been if they had met, only to have fate intervene years later.\n\n6. \"The Hating Game\" by Sally Thorne: This is a steamy and witty office romance about two coworkers who can't stand each other, but can't seem to stay away.\n\n7. \"The Love Letter\" by Victoria Purman: A romantic mystery about a woman who discovers a love letter hidden in an old book, and sets out to find out more about the romance that took place years ago, only to find herself drawn into the story herself.\n\n8. \"Everything, Everything\" by Nicola Yoon: A love story between a girl who is literally a prisoner in her own home, and the boy who dares to risk everything to be with her.\n\n9. \"The Secret of Lost Things\" by C.J. Tudor: A romance with a twist, set in a coastal town where a young woman returns to her hometown and rekindles a love affair with her childhood sweetheart, only to uncover a dark family secret.\n\n10. \"A Man Called Ove\" by Fredrik Backman: A heartwarming and humorous story about a grumpy old man who unexpectedly finds love and connection in the most unexpected of places.\n\n[Langsearch Result]\n\n\n\n\u2022 The 10 best Colleen Hoover books, ranked\n  https://nypost.com/2022/10/25/the-10-best-colleen-hoover-books-ranked/\n  the 10 best colleen hoover books , including \u2018 it ends with us \u2019 ny post composite when it comes to # booktok , colleen hoover ( aka the queen of romance ) is all the rage . whether you\u2019ve heard a...

These tools analyze the website traffic data from various sources, including search engines, social media, and direct visits. Here's a general outline of the process:\n\n1. Visit SimilarWeb, SEMrush, or Ahrefs (note that these are paid tools, but they offer limited free data).\n2. In the search bar, enter the website domain or URL you want to analyze.\n3. Wait for the tool to gather data and present the results.\n\nThese tools will provide you with an estimate of the website's monthly traffic, the average visit duration, and the number of pageviews. You can then divide the monthly traffic by 30 to estimate the number of daily visitors. Keep in mind that these estimates might not be 100% accurate, as they depend on the data sources and algorithms used by the tools.\n\nFor example, using SimilarWeb, I can see that `wikipedia.org` receives approximately 241 million monthly visits, so the estimated daily visitors would be around 8 million.\n\nKeep in mind that these figures can vary significantly depending on the specific website and its audience.\n\nLangsearch Result\n\n\n\n\u2022 Most Famous Countries - Top Ten List - TheTopTens\n  https://www.thetoptens.com/nations/most-famous-countries/\n  most famous countries the top ten united states the united states of america , or the u.s.a. for short , is a federal republic composed of 50 states , 48 of them are contiguous states . there ar...

It is home to a large percentage of the world's media, entertainment, and technological industries, and its political system and policies often set global trends.\n\nChina, on the other hand, is the most populous country in the world and has a long and rich history.

Some countries may be more well-known in certain areas due to their influence, cultural exports, or historical significance. For example, the United States is often recognized for its impact on pop culture, technology, and entertainment. However, countries like China, Russia, and India are also globally prominent due to their large populations and economic influence.

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted language that enables the creation of interactive elements on websites, such as animated graphics, photo slideshows, form validations, and more.\n\nJavaScript is distinct from Java, although they share some similarities in syntax. It's essential to know that JavaScript is mainly used on the client-side (front-end) of web development, while Java is often used for server-side (back-end) programming.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about JavaScript, its syntax, or its uses, feel free to ask! I'm here to help.\n\nOpenRouter Result\n\n\n JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used to develop dynamic and interactive web content. It was initially developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 to add interactivity to web pages.\n\nHere's a simple example of a JavaScript code that displays \"Hello, World!\" on a webpage:\n\n```javascript\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n\n<h1 id=\"demo\"><\/h1>\n\n<script>\ndocument.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = \"Hello, World!\";\n<\/script>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n```\n\nIn this example, we have an HTML file with a heading element that has an id of \"demo\". JavaScript is used to get the element with the id \"demo\" using `document.getElementById(\"demo\")`, and then it sets the innerHTML of the element to \"Hello, World!\".\n\nJavaScript is a versatile language and is essential for creating modern web applications. It can handle a wide range of tasks, such as:\n\n1. Form validation\n2. Creating interactive user interfaces\n3. Manipulating HTML, CSS, and DOM elements\n4. Responding to user events like clicks and keypresses\n5. Making network requests to servers\n6. Creating animations and visual effects\n7. Developing complex applications using libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.\n\nJavaScript is an essential part of the modern web development stack, and it is useful for both front-end and back-end development.\n\nLangsearch Result\n\n\n\n\u2022 An Introduction to JavaScript\n  https://javascript.info/intro\n  an introduction to javascript let \u2019s see what \u2019s so special about javascript , what we can achieve with it , and what other technologies play well with it . what is javascript ? javascript was i...
